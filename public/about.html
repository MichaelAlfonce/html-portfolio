<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is <strong>Alfonce Mwelelu a web developer</strong>.I finished my highschool in 2022 and joined <strong> Multimedia university of kenya</strong> in september 2023 for a course dubbed Bachelor of science in Computer science due to my previous inspiration and love for programming and computer operations.

<p>
  The programming that we do in school(<strong>Multimedia university of kenya</strong>) has really inspired me to having the need to learn more on programming and my love for creating websites brought me to Udemy where I acquired my first course(The Complete Web DEvelopment) by <strong> DR. Angela Yu.</strong>

  For now I don't have a lot of experience in web development but I am able to create presenteable web pages and with time I wil be able to learn more
